# Clustering by measuring local direction centrality for data with heterogeneous density and weak connectivity (CDC)

# Introduction
In this work, we propose a novel Clustering algorithm by measuring Direction Centrality (CDC) locally. Its core idea is to detect the boundary points of clusters firstly, and then connect the internal points within the enclosed cages generated by surrounding boundary points. We consider the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) of internal points to be different from that of boundary points in spatial distribution. Specifically, an internal point of clusters tends to be surrounded by its neighboring points in all directions, while a boundary point only includes neighboring points within a certain directional range. Taking advantage of this difference, we measure the local centrality by calculating the angle variance of KNNs to distinguish the internal and boundary points. This algorithm utilizes KNN to search the neighboring points, which is irrelevant to the point density and can preserve the completeness of sparse clusters. Meanwhile, CDC outlines the irregular cluster shapes and avoids the cross-cluster connections, thus separating weakly connected clusters effectively.

# How To Run

This section introduces how to use the provided MATLAB, Python and R codes to run the CDC algorithm

--- 1) MATLAB for 2D data ---

	data = textread('DS1.txt');
	[n,~] = size(data);
	X = data(:,1:2);
	ref = data(:,3);
	% Read TXT file (this matlab code only for 2D data)
	
	clus = CDC(X,30,1,0.1);
	% Run CDC algorithm
	
	[ACC, NMI, ARI, Fscore, JI, RI] = ClustEval(ref, clus);
	% Calculate the validity metrics
	
	plotcluster(n,X,clus);
	% Plot the clustering result

--- 2) Python for 2D data ---

	raw_data = pd.read_table('DS1.txt', header=None)
	X = np.array(raw_data)
	data = X[:, :2]
	ref = X[:, 2]
	res = CDC(30, 0.1, data)

	plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=res, s=20, cmap='hsv', marker='o')
	plt.show()

--- 3) R for any dimension ---

	data <- read.table('wine.txt',header = FALSE,sep = '\t')
	dat_mat <- as.matrix(data[,1:(ncol(data)-1)])
	dat_mat <- dat_mat[,colSums(dat_mat)>0]
	dat_label <- unlist(data[,ncol(data)])
	norm_dat_mat <- dat_mat
	### Read TXT data

	for (i in 1:ncol(dat_mat)){
  	    if ((max(dat_mat[,i])-min(dat_mat[,i]))>0){
    	        norm_dat_mat[,i]<-(dat_mat[,i]-min(dat_mat[,i]))/(max(dat_mat[,i])-min(dat_mat[,i]))
  	    }
	}
	### Normalize the input data (You can also not normalize the data)

	res <- CDC(norm_dat_mat, embeding_method = "UMAP", npc = 5, k = 20, ratio = 0.8)
	clus <- as.integer(res)
	### Run CDC algorithm
	# embedding_method: {"UMAP": Use UMAP to reduce the dimensions; "None": Do not reduce the dimensions}
	# npc: The dimension of the space to embed into using UMAP
	# k: k of KNN
	# ratio: A percentile ratio measuring the proportion of internal points

	metrics <- matrix(0,nrow=1,ncol=4)
	metrics[1,1] <- mclust::adjustedRandIndex(clus, dat_label)
	metrics[1,2] <- ACC(dat_label,clus)
	metrics[1,3] <- ClusterR::external_validation(dat_label,clus,method="nmi")
	metrics[1,4] <- ClusterR::external_validation(dat_label,clus,method="jaccard_index")
	### Calculate the validity metrics (ARI, ACC, NMI, JI)
